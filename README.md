- Something you don’t want to happen every 10 seconds
  - Something comedic?
- You're a secret agent, but you have diarrhoea, and have to find a toilet every 10 seconds while fighting your way through whatever

- Animation changes every 10 seconds
- You die every 10 seconds
  - Could do something like your bodies pile up so you need to die in the same place in order to get over an obstacle
  - You must die on a switch/button in order to press it
  - Bodies disappear after 30 seconds
  - You respawn at the same place every 10 seconds
  - Your body stays around for some time
    - This timer could change / be an effect you pick up
  - Puzzles (this button opens this door) are connected with lines - you’d have to follow them to see what each one did
- Every 10 seconds, more cake appears in an eating contest. Consume it faster than you opponents to grow as large as possible.
